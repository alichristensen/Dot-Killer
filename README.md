### Add and remove ideas and to-do items
# Game Rules
1. Player must *kill* all the *dots* by launching a ball at them.
2. If the players ball collides with a dot of the same color, they *dot* is destroyed and the players ball with continue to travel until it is either off of the screen or hits a dot of a different color.
3. If the players ball collides with a dot of a different color, only the players ball is destroyed
4. The player should be able to launch an new ball shortly after one is shot so the game will move along quickly

# To Do
1. Think of a couple interesting mechanics for the balls the player launches
2. Think of one or two bonuses for the player
  1. Bouncy ball that will bounce off of dots and the screen edges. It could also change color periodically (only allowed a certain number of bounces before it is destroyed).
